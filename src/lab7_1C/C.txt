The hashCode method is not override. The contains method of List check whether the given item is in the given list.
To check it elements it uses equals method of List interface. Ih this case the equals method takes Employee Reference object.
Upto this all are ok. The problem is that contain method of List uses HashMap. So it must over Override the hashCode function.
